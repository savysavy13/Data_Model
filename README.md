# Data_Model
This is my capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Course
This is my capstone project work from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Course from
Coursera it follows a PACE framework i.e: Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute. The goal of this
project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a machinemodel that
predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.If we can predict employees likely
to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is
time-consuming and expensive to hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be
beneficial to the company. But, before building our machine learning model we will have to
perform some data cleaning and EDA. The first half of the project requires Data Cleaning and
EDA. Then we move onto finding co-relations between the variables, for this purpose we use a
variety of data visualizations such as pie charts, histograms and line graphs. Seaborn library is
primarily used for building the data visualizations. Co-relation matrix is also used to determine
the relationship b/w the different variables. Then , a logistic regression model is constructed
which performs relatively well.Finally, a random forest classifier is constructed as they are better
able to handle imbalanced data. To futher improve the accuracy of our random forest model we
deploy XGBoost, which is a boosting algorithm that enhances the random forest classifier by
combining decision trees iteratively to improve model accuracy and generalization.
